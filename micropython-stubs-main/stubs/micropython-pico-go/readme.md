# About the Pico Go Stubs
This folder contains a copy of the MicroPython stubs for the Raspberry Pi Pico
Any of the stubs located in this folder are copied from the /frozen folder and are re-arranged for the target linter (Pylint or Pylance).

These stubs are not generated. They're hand-written and maintained by Chris Wood, with a little help from micropython-stubber.
